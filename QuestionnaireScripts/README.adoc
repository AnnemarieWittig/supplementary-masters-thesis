= Questionnaire Scripts

This directory contains scripts for processing, analyzing, and visualizing questionnaire data collected from study participants. The scripts integrate survey responses with the quantitative analysis results to provide a comprehensive view of participant characteristics and experiences.

The underlying data is stored in the university's GitLab, too. Refer to the Root README for further information.

== Scripts

=== link:create_demographics_table.ipynb[`create_demographics_table.ipynb`] - Participant Demographics Analysis

This notebook processes questionnaire data to create the demographics table presented in section 4.1 of the thesis. It transforms the categories into appropriate visualizations, stored in link:graphics/participant_table/[`graphics/participant_table`]


==== Analysis Categories
* **Experience Metrics** (histograms):
    - `profYearsProgramming` - Professional programming experience (years)
    - `progExp` - Overall programming experience level
    - `yearsProgramming` - Total years programming
* **Background Information** (mean or count):
** `projectSize` - Size of projects typically worked on
** `education` - Highest educational achievement
** `framework` - Development frameworks used
** `ide` - Integrated development environments used
** `progLang` - Primary programming languages
* **Comparative Assessments** (likert style plots):
** `progExpCompared[CEE1]` - Experience compared to colleagues
** `progExpCompared[CTE]` - Experience compared to team
** `progExpCompared[PE]` - Experience compared to peers

=== link:create_questionnaire_list.ipynb[`create_questionnaire_list.ipynb`] - Response Analysis and Aggregation

This notebook generates summary statistics for each of the analyzed questionnaire answers, visualizing histograms for each of the answers.

It also utilizes the merged overview to generate the group separated visualizations and statistics (positive, negative, mixed, trendless groups), utilizing a questionnaire mapping (path set in file) to change how questions are visualized.

== Configuration and Dependencies

=== Environment Variables
Uses the same `.env` configuration as other analysis scripts:

[source,env]
----
RESULTS_DIRECTORY=/path/to/analysis/results
BUCKET_SIZE=90
PARTICIPANTS_TO_REMOVE=['participant1','participant2']
----
=== Dependencies
[source,bash]
----
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plot-likert numpy
----

== Output Structure

=== link:QuestionnaireFiles/[`QuestionnaireFiles/`] - Processed Survey Data
Currently empty, intended for storing processed questionnaire datasets.

=== link:graphics/[`graphics/`] - Generated Visualizations

==== link:graphics/participant_table/[`participant_table/`] - Demographics Visualizations
* **`profYearsProgramming_distribution.png`** - Professional experience distribution
* **`progExp_distribution.png`** - Overall programming experience levels
* **`yearsProgramming_distribution.png`** - Total programming experience distribution
* **`progExpCompared[CEE1]_likerts.png`** - Experience comparison with colleagues
* **`progExpCompared[CTE]_likerts.png`** - Experience comparison with team
* **`progExpCompared[PE]_likerts.png`** - Experience comparison with peers

== Analysis Workflow
The workflow is the same it is for the other analysis scripts.


== Integration with Thesis
