= The Productivity Impact of Software Developers Using LLM-based Coding Assistants: Supplementary Material

In this GitHub repository, I present the supplementary materials to my Master's thesis.

This thesis was written by Annemarie Wittig under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Norbert Siegmund with Prof. Dr. Martin Middendorf as second referee at Leipzig University.

The data used in the analysis scripts is stored in Leipzig University's own GitLab instance to ensure data security. If wanted, those with a suitable login may be granted access. Otherwise, the scripts can be tested with your own data that you can collect with my repository data collection scripts.
I share the scripts I used to collect data from the repositories / version control systems in a separate GitHub repository. You can find extensive explanations on how to run these scripts there: https://github.com/AnnemarieWittig/AiToolsInDevelopment


== Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders:

* link:AnalysisScripts/[`AnalysisScripts/`] - Contains the statistical analysis scripts used to process the collected repository data and generate the results presented in the thesis. These scripts analyze developer productivity metrics and the impact of LLM-based coding assistants.

* link:AnalysisOutputs/[`AnalysisOutputs/`] - Stores the output files generated by the analysis scripts, including statistical results, processed datasets, and intermediate analysis files.

* link:Graphics/[`Graphics/`] - Contains the visualizations, charts, and figures generated from the analysis that are included in the thesis to illustrate the findings.

* link:OverviewGraphicScripts/[`OverviewGraphicScripts/`] - Houses the scripts responsible for creating overview graphics and summary visualizations that provide high-level insights into the research findings.
